This sample is a c# version of the BasicPlayer sample included in the
Media Foundation SDK.  It allows you to use MF to play various media files.

Note that in order to play wave files, you need to compile and register the 
WavSource sample.

The most significant difference has to do with how error handling is performed.
See "Error handling" in docs\ReadMe.rtf for details.
