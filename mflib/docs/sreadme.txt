Media Foundation Lib Samples 2007-07-15

http://mflib.SourceForge.net

These samples should not be considered commercial quality applications.  They are just 
intended to illustrate how to use some particular feature, or group of features in 
Media Foundation.  Feel free to polish them into applications of your own, or extract 
sections to use in your own code.  Each sample has (at least one) readme file.  
If you are looking for info regarding a sample, these are always a good place to start.

Also, while the Media Foundation library is licensed under LGPL, these samples are 
public domain.  Use them as you like.  Every one of these samples needs the MediaFoundation
library which is not included in this package.  Get the latest version of the library from 
the SourceForge website.

The people who wrote these samples usually hang out in 
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=711229.  If you have questions, 
comments, or just want to say thanks to the people who have taken the time to
create these, feel free to stop by.

Also, if you have samples you think would be useful (or would like to write some), 
that would be the place to get started.
