There have been *significant* changes since beta 2.  Commenting,
more enums, and some serious re-working of the PropVariant class,
which affects a number methods.

In addition to testing a bunch more interfaces and externs, I have 
finished translating 7 of the 8 samples that ship with the the PSDK, 
plus 1 sample that only exists in the mf sdk docs.  Note: The samples 
are in a separate download.  Make sure you grab it too!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

A few more tested externs (for the GrayScale sample)
Two more tested interfaces: IMFTransform, IMF2DBuffer
